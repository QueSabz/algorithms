# Algorithms, 4th Edition

The textbook Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne surveys the most important algorithms and data structures in use today. We motivate each algorithm that we address by examining its impact on applications to science, engineering, and industry.

Algorithms, 4th Edition is made available by its authors, and can be found [here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
